# Embedded LUA

Based on on tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l5HdmPoynw&t=307s

Development was done on Windows10 in Visual Studio 2017 in C++.


Note: If you get a linker error, switch your build to x86. 

Note: Running outside of visual studio - the exe needs to be run from the folder with Lua540/ folder; also, the lua files should be present.
